# Budget-Tracker

Budget tracker app allows users to add and subtract funds/expenses and make deposits while giving the user their money balance. The app still retains full functionality while offline as well. 

You can add funds and name the transaction all while the amount updates on the right. 

There's also a graph that shows a "Total Over Time" in purple.
